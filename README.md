Hi, I’m TeamingStatue, I'm just a guy trying ot learn how to code. I'm currently learning HTML and CSS, while building a small website to practice what I'm learning.

- I work in IT and would like to eventually land myself a network architect role.
- I like being challenged in my day to day job activities, and I enjoy learning how things work and fit together to make one fucntioning process.
- Learning how to code is mostly just a side project as I'd like to eventually build an asset management web app
